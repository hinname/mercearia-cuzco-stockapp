## About the Project

The application is designed to be easy to use and provide a simple way for owners to keep track of their stock products.  
This project was created for the **Mobile with React Native** course at university. It is a mobile stock app developed for a company I worked with, *Mercearia Cuzco*, a grocery store located in Rio de Janeiro.

The application was built using **React Native** and **Expo** for the mobile app, a web API using **Node.js** with **Fastify**, and **SQLite** as the database (just for the MVP).

### Features

- **CRUD operations for products and users**: You can Create, Read, Update, and Delete products and users.
- **Login with authentication**: Authentication using JWT tokensâ€”only authorized tokens can send critical requests to the API.
- **WhatsApp integration**: When you create a user, you can automatically send a WhatsApp message with their login details.
